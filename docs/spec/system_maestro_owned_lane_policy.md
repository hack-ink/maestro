# Maestro Owned-Lane Policy

Purpose: Define the authoritative fallback policy for Maestro-owned lanes, including when automation may continue, wait, retry, resume a retained lane, or must stop for human intervention.
Status: normative
Read this when: You need the decision matrix for manual intervention, automatic recovery, post-review waiting, retained-lane repair re-entry, or ready-to-land determination.
Not this document: The low-level app-server contract, the full runtime state machine, the downstream `WORKFLOW.md` schema, or the operator step-by-step pilot procedure.
Defines: The stable decision classes, authoritative signals, human-handoff boundaries, automatic-recovery prerequisites, and the ownership boundary between the runtime model and local workflow implementation.

## Design reference

- `openai/symphony` `README.md` and `SPEC.md` are the only external design standard for this policy.
- This policy follows Symphony's stable boundaries:
  - the service is a scheduler and runner, not a general-purpose workflow engine
  - work intake is tracker-backed
  - execution happens in isolated per-issue workspaces
  - workflow policy is repository-owned
  - observability and trust posture are explicit runtime concerns
- Maestro-local extensions such as `WORKFLOW.md [context.read_first]` and the installed workflow skills are execution-context inputs for a compliant implementation. They are not the core domain model of this policy, and they do not replace the primary `WORKFLOW.md` body defined by Symphony.

## Scope

This policy applies to one Maestro-owned lane at a time, from initial claim through review handoff, retained-lane recovery, landing readiness, and final cleanup.

This policy does not require one concrete implementation strategy. A compliant implementation may satisfy the policy through different local workflow tooling as long as the same decisions, signals, and safety boundaries remain true.

## Core principle

The policy is defined in terms of stable runtime decisions and authoritative signals, not in terms of specific local workflow helpers.

The runtime must decide only among these action classes:

- `continue`
- `wait_for_external_signal`
- `retry_automatically`
- `resume_retained_lane`
- `manual_intervention_required`
- `ready_to_land`

The runtime must not invent new action classes at execution time.

Review-request submission, acknowledgement probing, and bounded resend behavior are not separate action classes. They are orchestration behaviors that may happen while the lane remains in `wait_for_external_signal`.

## Authoritative signals

The runtime may use only the following signal groups to decide lane behavior:

- Tracker state:
  - issue workflow state
  - tracker labels
  - blocker state
  - explicit authority comments written during the run
- Retained-lane state:
  - workspace existence
  - guarded markers such as `.maestro-terminal-guarded`
  - activity markers such as `.maestro-run-activity`
  - current attempt and retry-budget bookkeeping
- Review state:
  - whether the recorded PR still matches the lane branch and validated head
  - whether the PR is still open, closed without merge, or merged
  - review approval or requested-change state
  - unresolved review-thread state
  - required-check state
  - mergeability
- Closeout state:
  - whether merge already happened
  - whether authoritative delivery closeout has run
  - whether workspace and branch cleanup are still pending

If these signals disagree and the disagreement cannot be resolved without guessing operator intent, the runtime must choose `manual_intervention_required`.

## Action classes

### `continue`

`continue` means the current automation-owned path is still valid and should keep progressing without pausing for a new external signal.

Examples:

- the live lane is still running and remains eligible
- a merge already happened and the same automation-owned sequence should continue into closeout and cleanup

### `wait_for_external_signal`

`wait_for_external_signal` means the lane is healthy, but the next transition depends on an outside event rather than immediate new agent work.

Examples:

- the lane is in `In Review` and no actionable review feedback exists yet
- required checks are still running
- a review request was sent for the current PR head and the runtime is waiting for review activity or an implementation-defined acknowledgement window to elapse

### `retry_automatically`

`retry_automatically` means the current attempt failed in a retryable way and the runtime still owns the next attempt.

This action requires:

- remaining retry budget
- the issue still being active under retry policy
- no explicit human-attention signal

### `resume_retained_lane`

`resume_retained_lane` means the runtime may safely re-enter an existing retained workspace and continue work on the same owned lane instead of starting a fresh lane.

This action requires:

- the retained workspace still exists
- the retained workspace still matches the owned issue and branch
- the tracker or review signals clearly indicate the same lane should continue
- an explicit retained review-handoff lineage marker is still present when the lane already crossed into post-review ownership
- retained post-review re-entry can still prove the same PR lineage, even when the current
  repair attempt advances to a newer head on that same PR

### `manual_intervention_required`

`manual_intervention_required` means automation must stop because continuing would require guessing, would violate policy, or would hide an unresolved blocker.

This action is mandatory when:

- retry budget is exhausted
- the agent explicitly requests human attention
- the lane is stalled
- terminal signaling is missing or contradictory
- required labels cannot be applied and the runtime must fall back to a guarded non-startable state
- retained workspace, tracker state, or PR state disagree in a way that is not safely self-healing
- post-review signals are ambiguous enough that repair, wait, and land are all plausible

### `ready_to_land`

`ready_to_land` means the runtime may proceed into the landing sequence for an owned PR-backed lane.

This action requires:

- the lane already completed PR-backed review handoff
- required approvals are satisfied
- actionable review repair is no longer pending
- required checks are green
- the PR is mergeable under repository policy

`ready_to_land` is a decision boundary, not a guarantee that landing and closeout are already complete.

## Decision table

| Observed condition | Minimum authoritative signals | Required action | Automatic recovery allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Running lane remains eligible and activity is current | Current issue state is still active; no interrupting state transition; activity marker or session state still live | `continue` | Not applicable |
| Clean worker exit with remaining retry budget | Retry budget remains; issue is still active; no `maestro:needs-attention` label or equivalent human-attention signal | `retry_automatically` | Yes |
| Abnormal worker exit with remaining retry budget | Same as above, plus failure is classified as retryable | `retry_automatically` | Yes |
| Retry exhausted, explicit human-attention signal, or stalled lane | Retry budget exhausted, or `maestro:needs-attention`, or stalled-run evidence | `manual_intervention_required` | No |
| Human-attention label is unavailable but the failure path still must block redispatch | Failure path is human-required; label application failed; guarded retained marker recorded | `manual_intervention_required` | No |
| Retained non-terminal lane still matches issue, branch, and owned recovery intent | Retained workspace exists; issue still belongs to the owned lane; recovery signals are consistent | `resume_retained_lane` | Yes |
| `In Review` lane has no actionable review yet | PR still belongs to lane; no requested changes that require repair; checks or review are still pending | `wait_for_external_signal` | Yes, when new signal arrives |
| `In Review` lane now has actionable review repair work | PR still belongs to lane; actionable review feedback is present; retained lane remains reusable | `resume_retained_lane` | Yes |
| `In Review` lane has green checks, satisfied review, and is mergeable | PR still belongs to lane; approvals satisfied; unresolved blocking review work absent; checks green; mergeable | `ready_to_land` | Yes |
| Pre-PR self-review or post-review repair churn exceeded the configured convergence budget | Repeated new structural findings or repair rounds crossed the configured limit; the lane no longer has a bounded low-risk patch path | `manual_intervention_required` | No |
| Merge already happened but closeout or cleanup is incomplete | Merge commit exists; closeout or cleanup evidence is still missing | `continue` | Yes |
| Signals are contradictory or incomplete in a way that requires guesswork | Tracker, retained lane, review, or cleanup signals disagree materially | `manual_intervention_required` | No |

## Human-intervention boundaries

Automation must stop and require a human when any of these are true:

- the lane needs a decision that cannot be derived from authoritative signals alone
- continuing would rewrite or override evidence the operator should inspect first
- the runtime cannot prove that the retained workspace, PR, and tracker issue still belong to the same owned lane
- a required failure guard could not be applied cleanly
- the lane has already crossed the configured retry or repair convergence limit

Human intervention is not complete merely because a human observed the failure. Human intervention is complete only when the blocking signal is materially cleared.

Examples of materially cleared signals:

- `maestro:needs-attention` is removed and the issue is returned to a startable state
- the retained workspace is repaired or explicitly discarded and the runtime can safely choose the next lane action again
- review feedback is resolved or clarified enough that the runtime can classify the lane as wait, repair, or land without guessing

## Automatic-recovery prerequisites

Automatic recovery is allowed only when all of the following are true:

- the authoritative blocker was actually cleared, not merely commented on
- the lane still has a valid owned workspace or a clearly recoverable replacement path
- the tracker issue is in the expected active or handoff state for the recovery path
- the recovery action is one of the allowed action classes in this document

Automation must not resume solely because a daemon restarted, a timer elapsed, or a retained workspace still exists on disk.

## Ambiguous-case rules

### Flaky CI

- If required checks are still pending or have a retriable platform failure without new code changes, the runtime may stay in `wait_for_external_signal`.
- If the lane needs a new code change or an operator judgment about the failing signal, the runtime must use `manual_intervention_required` until a later implementation explicitly supports that retry class.

### Review-request lag or missing reaction

- Whether the current PR head needs a fresh review request is an orchestration decision, not a core domain state.
- Sending or re-sending a review request is an implementation action performed by the local workflow adapter for the current environment.
- A review request should be bound to the current PR head and should leave auditable evidence such as a platform-native review-request state change or an attributable request comment for that head.
- If the request was sent successfully and the lane is otherwise healthy, the runtime should remain in `wait_for_external_signal` rather than treating the lack of immediate review activity as a failure.
- If the implementation-defined acknowledgement window elapses with no reliable evidence that the request was accepted for the current head, the runtime may perform a bounded resend for that same head.
- If bounded resend is exhausted, or repeated requests still leave the runtime unable to determine whether review was requested successfully, the runtime must switch to `manual_intervention_required`.

### Dismissed security alerts

- A dismissed security alert is not, by itself, an open repair obligation.
- The runtime should treat the current required-check state and unresolved review state as authoritative, not stale alert shells alone.
- If the alert state and required-check state disagree materially, the runtime must require human intervention instead of guessing.

### Stale retained workspaces

- A retained workspace may be reused only when it still matches the owned issue and branch and there is no contradictory terminal evidence.
- If the retained workspace exists but ownership or branch identity is unclear, the runtime must require human intervention.

### Missing labels or partial closeout

- Missing failure labels require a guarded non-startable state and human repair before redispatch.
- Partial closeout keeps the lane automation-owned only when the merge result is already authoritative and the remaining steps are deterministic closeout or cleanup.
- If closeout authority is unclear, the runtime must require human intervention.

## Ownership boundary

This policy is normative about runtime decisions and safety boundaries.

This policy is not normative about the exact local helper names used to satisfy those decisions.

In particular:

- deciding whether a pre-PR self-review gate is satisfied belongs to orchestration
- deciding whether the current PR head needs a fresh review request belongs to orchestration
- counting pre-PR self-review churn and post-review repair churn belongs to orchestration
- deciding that the lane has crossed from bounded repair into architecture rethink or manual escalation belongs to orchestration
- executing the concrete review-request side effect belongs to the local workflow adapter
- retrying that side effect after missing acknowledgement is an orchestration policy decision implemented through the same local adapter
- the core runtime model should record only the resulting evidence and current decision class, not a permanent dependency on one helper name, one round counter implementation, or one comment syntax

One compliant local implementation may map the action classes in this document onto:

- retained clone-backed workspaces for lane lifecycle
- saved execution plans for implementation authority
- explicit review request and review repair flows
- a separate PR landing step
- a separate delivery closeout step
- a separate cleanup step

That mapping is informative. Future local workflow tooling may change as long as the same decision classes and safety boundaries remain true.
